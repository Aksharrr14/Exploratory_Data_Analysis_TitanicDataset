# Exploratory_Data_Analysis_TitanicDataset
This repository contains the code and findings of an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project on the Titanic dataset. EDA is a crucial step in understanding the data, identifying patterns, and drawing meaningful insights.

## Introduction

The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, resulting in the deaths of more than 1,500 passengers and crew. The dataset used in this project contains various attributes of passengers, such as age, class, and fare, along with information on whether they survived or not. The objective of this EDA project is to explore the dataset and uncover insights about the passengers' demographics and their survival.

## Key Highlights

- Data Cleaning: The dataset may contain missing values and inconsistencies. The EDA process includes data cleaning to ensure the dataset is ready for analysis.

- Data Visualization: Data is presented visually through charts and graphs to provide a clear understanding of the data distribution and relationships.

- Exploratory Analysis: We delve into the dataset to answer questions such as:
  - What were the demographics of the passengers?
  - How many passengers survived, and how many perished?
  - Were certain groups more likely to survive?
